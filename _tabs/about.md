I’m a Machine Learning Engineer at Eightfold AI. Previously, I graduated in 2022 from the Computer Science and Engineering department at IIT Bombay. I currently live in Sunnyvale, California.

I have been working on agentic search systems and large-scale LLM-powered ETL pipelines. I’m particularly interested in methods to systematically evaluate and improve the performance of large, compound AI systems with many moving parts—leveraging data and optimization techniques.
In my free time, I look at the data.

I unwind with FIFA matches, YouTube rabbit holes, relaxing in the jacuzzi, and the occasional dopamine detox.
